Zomato Data Analysis

Project Overview

This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Zomato restaurant data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. The analysis covers data preprocessing, visualization, and business insights to help understand customer preferences, restaurant performance, and online order trends.

Dataset

The dataset contains information about restaurants, including:

Restaurant Name

Rating

Votes

Online Order Availability

Cost for Two People

Type of Restaurant

Key Data Science Techniques Applied

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, converting rating formats, and correcting inconsistent data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to visualize trends.

Statistical Insights: Identifying key factors affecting restaurant popularity and online order behavior.

Feature Engineering: Transforming categorical data for better interpretability.

Insights & Findings

Online Ordering Trends: Visualization of how many restaurants accept online orders.

Most Popular Restaurant Type: Count plots showing the distribution of different types of restaurants.

Impact of Ratings: Analyzing how rating distributions affect customer engagement.

Revenue Indicators: Understanding the relation between cost for two people and restaurant success.

Restaurant Popularity: Identifying restaurants with the highest votes.
